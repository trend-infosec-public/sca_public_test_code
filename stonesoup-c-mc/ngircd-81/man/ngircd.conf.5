.SH NAME
ngircd.conf \- configuration file of ngIRCd
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /usr/local/etc/ngircd.conf
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR ngircd.conf
is the configuration file for
.BR ngircd (8)
which you should adept to your local preferences and needs.
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
The file consists of sections and parameters. A section begins with the name
of the section in square brackets and continues until the next section
begins.
.PP
Sections contain parameters of the form
.PP
.RS
.I name
=
.I value
.RE
.PP
Any line beginning with a semicolon (';') or a hash ('#') character is
treated as a comment and ignored.
.PP
The file format is line-based - that means, each newline-terminated line
represents either a comment, a section name or a parameter.
.PP
Section and parameter names are not case sensitive.
.SH "SECTION OVERVIEW"
The file is separated in four blocks: [Global], [Operator], [Server],
and [Channel].
.PP
In the
.I [Global]
section, there is the main configuration like the server name and the
ports, on which the server should be listening. IRC operators of this
server are defined in
.I [Operator]
blocks.
.I [Server]
is the section where server links are configured. And
.I [Channel]
blocks are used to configure pre-defined ("persistent") IRC channels.
.SH [GLOBAL]
The
.I [Global]
section is used to define the server main configuration, like the server
name and the ports on which the server should be listening.
.TP
\fBName\fR

.TP
\fBInfo\fR

example.
.TP
\fBAdminInfo1\fR, \fBAdminInfo2\fR, \fBAdminEMail\fR
Information about the server and the administrator, used by the ADMIN
command.
.TP
\fBPorts\fR
Ports on which the server should listen. There may be more than one port,
separated with ';'. Default: 6667.
.TP
\fBListen\fR
The ip address on which the server should listen. Default is empty, so

to all users connecting to the server.
.TP

or the numerical ID.
.PP
.RS

must be readable by this user, otherwise RESTART and REHASH won't work!
.RE
.TP
\fBServerGID\fR
Group ID under which the ngIRCd should run; you can use the name of the
group or the numerical ID.
.PP
.RS
.B Attention:
.br

.RE
.TP

(or no longer) connected servers. Default: 60.

not(!) channel-operators? Default: no.
.TP
\fBMaxConnections\fR
Maximum number of simultaneous connection the server is allowed to accept
(<=0: unlimited). Default: -1.
.TP
\fBMaxConnectionsIP\fR

.TP
\fBPassword\fR

.SH [SERVER]
Other servers are configured in
.I [Server]
sections. If you configure a port for the connection, then this ngIRCd
tries to connect to to the other server on the given port; if not, it waits
for the other server to connect.
.PP
The ngIRCd allows "server groups": You can assign an "ID" to every server
with which you want this ngIRCd to link. If a server of a group won't
answer, the ngIRCd tries to connect to the next server in the given group.
But ngIRCd never tries to connect to two servers with the same group ID.

There may be more than one
.I [Server]
block.
.TP
\fBName\fR
IRC name of the server
.TP
\fBHost\fR

the ngIRCd waits for incoming connections.

"PeerPassword" on the other server.
.TP
\fBPeerPassword\fR
Foreign password for this connection. This password has to be configured as
"MyPassword" on the other server.
.TP
\fBGroup\fR
Group of this server (optional).
.SH [CHANNEL]
Pre-defined channels can be configured in
.I [Channel]
sections. Such channels are created by the server when starting up and even
persist when there are no more members left.
.PP
Persistent channels are marked with the mode 'P', which can be set and unset
by IRC operators like other modes on the fly.
.PP
There may be more than one
.I [Channel]
block.

.SH HINTS
It's wise to use "ngircd --configtest" to validate the configuration file
after changing it. See
.BR ngircd (8)
for details.
