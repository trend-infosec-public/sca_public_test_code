This is a java CGI application. It expects to be run in the context of a standard CGI workflow which involves setting environment variables before execution. This particular application only requires two to be set: "HTTP_METHOD" (which should be set to "GET") and "QUERY_STRING" which should be set to the values laid out in good1-in.txt, good1-out.txt, and bad1-in.txt in the testData directory.

Under a bash shell, here is how to run those three examples, along with the output they generate. My understanding is that there's a CGI workflow that the application will be plugged into, but given my lack of access to it, I thought some command line tests would be appropriate. I also understand that these will be imported into Eclipse, but to facilitate testing, I will be checking in a dist/CGIRedirector.jar file which will contain the stonesoup.CGIRedirector class and an appropriate manifest file.
